## About Me
  ![](https://nzenovic.github.io/nzenovic/headshot.jpg)
  
  
  

I have an MA in Social Sciences - Anthropology from the University of Chicago. 

I obtained my B.A. in Anthropology and Peace & Conflict Studies from the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. In addition to my double major, I minored in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian Languages and Literatures. 

I am interested in socio-cultural and linguistic anthropology and regionally focus in the Balkans and former Yugoslavia. I am fascinated by understandings of identity, language ideologies, nationalism, diaspora, immigration, and social movements.

I am also passionate about ethnographic research methods, research ethics, and academic mentorship.
