## About Me
  ![](https://nzenovic.github.io/nzenovic/headshot.jpg){width=200px}
  

  

I hold an M.A. in Social Sciences - Anthropology from the University of Chicago (2020). 

In 2018, I obtained my B.A., *summa cum laude*, in Anthropology and Peace & Conflict Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, where I also completed a minor in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian Languages and Literatures. 
My family history and frequent trips to the Balkans fostered my interests in socio-cultural and linguistic anthropology, with a regional focus in former Yugoslavia. I am fascinated by understandings of identity, language ideologies, nationalism, diaspora, immigration, protests, and social movements.

Some of my passions include ethnographic research methods, research ethics, academic mentorship, tennis, and dance.
